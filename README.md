# JavaCoreAndSpring
## Spring in a Nutshell
- Very popular framework
- Initially a simpler and lightweight alternative to J2EE.
- Provides a large number of helper classes... makes things easier.

## Why Spring?
- Simplify Java Enterprise Development.
## Goal of Spring
- Lightweight development with Java POJOs (Plain-Old-Java-Objects).
- Dependency injection to promote loose coupling.
- Declerative programming with Aspect-Oriented-Programming (AOP).
- Minimize boilerplate Java code.
## What are Spring "projects"?
  - Additional Spring modules built-on top of the core Spring Framework.
  - Only use what you need...
    * Spring cloud, Spring data...
    * Spring batch, Spring security...
    * Spring for Android, Spring Web Flow...
    * Spring Web Services, Spring LDAP...
## Inversion of Control (IoC)
- **The approach of outsourcing the construction and management of objects**
